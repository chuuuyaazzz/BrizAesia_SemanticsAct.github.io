                <p>I was introduced to tennis when I was 7 but<br>
                I then quickly lost motivation, making me pause and<br>
                return this year. Tennis is a really fun yet frustrating<br>
                sport to play. It even sometimes makes me ragequit. But<br>
                It also teaches me important values while my favorite tennis<br>
                players, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer motivate me to keep playing  </p>

            <h3>Fun Fact</h3>
            <p>The longest tennis match lasted 11 hours and 5 minutes</p>

            <p>In 2010, John Isner and Nicolas Mahut played the longest tennis<br>
                 match in history at Wimbledon. The match lasted for 11 hours and<br>
                  5 minutes, spread over three days, with the final score being 6-4,<br>
                   3-6, 6-7, 7-6, and 70-68. The match was so long that the scoreboard<br>
                    ran out of space for the score and had to be manually changed.</p>
